# WebsiteCrawlerEmailExtractor

I couldn't find a email scraper that worked to my specifications - so I just parsed together what i found online and made my own. Just input the URL to the following variable, $inputtedURL = $_GET['url']; and this script will get all the pages associated with that domain & then pull back any emails. You can make this signficantly faster if you could limit it to contact pages.
